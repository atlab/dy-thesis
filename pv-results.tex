\section{Results}
\subsection{Networks of partial correlations}
Using the same protocol for calcium signal acquisition  and stimulus presentations as described in Chapter 2, we estimated the noise correlation structure in the superficial layers of visual cortex in 11 scans from 4 mice with PV+ interneurons genetically labeled with a red fluorescent marker.

Using the $C_{\sf sparse+latent}$ estimator described in Chapter 2, we obtained partial correlation matrices comprising sparse and latent components. Figure \ref{fig:pv1} depicts the sparse component connectivity in one of the 11 sites.
