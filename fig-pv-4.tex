{{\bf Orientation tuning dependence of functional connectivity by cell pair type}
Each data point represents the average over a site, $n=9$ sites, except for PV+/+ pairs where the data were pooled from all sites.  

{\bf A.} Average noise correlations binned by difference in preferred orientation in 9 sites for PV--/-- cell pairs (left), PV--/+ cell pairs (middle), and PV+/+ cell pairs (right, pooled from  all sites).  

{\bf B.} Average regularized partial noise correlations binned by difference in preferred orientation in 9 sites for PV--/-- cell pairs (left), PV--/+ cell pairs (middle), and PV+/+ cell pairs (right, pooled from  all sites).
