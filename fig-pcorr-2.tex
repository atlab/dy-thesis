{{\bf Performance of covariance estimators on samples from Ising models.}
{\bf A--D} Validation losses of covariance matrix estimators relative to the estimator whose structure matches the ground truth. 
The calculation is performed identically to Fig.~\ref{fig:1} Row 6 except Ising models are used as ground truth instead of Gaussian models.
This cross-validated evaluation correctly ranked the estimators despite the models' deviation from Gaussianity.
