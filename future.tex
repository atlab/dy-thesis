\section{Interpretation of functional connectivity}
A fortuitous fact of neurobiology is that the spiking activity of individual cells can we efficiently described as a function of external stimuli with simple statistical models with only a handful of parameters fitted to the data \citep{Carandini:2005}. From the original discovery and with subsequent refinement of such descriptions over the past 50+ years, constructs such as \emph{receptive fields} and \emph{orientation tuning} have become principal tools for defining the \emph{functional architecture} of sensory cortex, \emph{i.e.}\ the relationship between single-cell properties of neural function and the cell types, cortical layers, synaptic connectivity, and the physical arrangements of cells  \citep{Hubel:1962,Ohki:2005,Reid:2012}.
