Standard models of the primary visual cortex derive from characterizations of the responses of individual neurons to external stimuli \cite{Carandini:2004}. 
This methodological limitation restricted the scope of models to those dominated by feedforward, stimulus-driven activity. 
Yet neuroscientists have long recognized that the truly interesting properties of brain function must emerge from the internally generated activity arising in groups of interconnected neurons \cite{Yuste:2005}.
The one-neuron-at-a-time approach has shaped the statistical descriptions in
