\section{Objective}
To investigate the function of neural circuits, experimental neuroscientists need effective statistical descriptions of interactions in groups of neurons computed from recordings of their spiking activity. We refer to such statistical descriptions as \emph{functional connectivity}. In this thesis, I introduce the use of \emph{pairwise partial correlations} for describing the structure of population activity of densely sampled groups of neurons recorded by two-photon calcium imaging. I describe numerical approaches for estimating the pairwise partial correlations and demonstrate their relationship to the anatomical organization of the superficial layers of the mouse primary visual cortex.

\section{Single-cell descriptions of neural function}
A fortuitous fact of neurobiology is that the spiking activity of individual cells can we efficiently described as a function of external stimuli with simple statistical models with only a handful of parameters fitted to the data \citep{Carandini:2005}. From the original discovery and with subsequent refinement of such descriptions over the past 50+ years, constructs such as \emph{receptive fields} and \emph{orientation tuning} have become principal tools for defining the \emph{functional architecture} of sensory cortex, \emph{i.e.}\ the relationship between single-cell properties of neural function and the cell types, cortical layers, synaptic connectivity, and the physical arrangements of cells  \citep{Hubel:1962,Ohki:2005,Reid:2012}.

\section{Functional connectivity in multineuronal recordings}
Despite the remarkable success of single-cell descriptions of neural functions, neuroscientists have long recognized that the truly intriguing properties of brain function emerge in the interactions of cells between each other and the resulting intrinsically generated activity \citep{Yuste:2005}.  A major obstacle to investigating functional interactions in populations on neurons,
