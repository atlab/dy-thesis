{\bf Examples of functional connectivity with labeled PV+ interneurons}

{\bf A.} Populations neurons in superficial layers of visual cortex from three mice. 
The connectivity plot is generated using the same algorithm as in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}G.
The edges between nodes indicate the sparse component of the partial correlation matrix.
The latent units and correlations induced by them are not shown.

{\bf B.} The PV+ neurons and the sparse partial correlations between them in the same imaged sites.
